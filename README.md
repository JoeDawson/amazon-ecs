# Amazon ECS for Laravel

This is currently a work in progress, if you come across this as it is right now - **please use your own risk**.

Documentation will be updated tomorrow (as of this commit).

### Planned

- [ ] Finish Documentation
- [X] Locales
- [ ] Better Exception Handling
- [ ] Cart abilities, such as modifying, adding, clearing etc.
- [ ] XML to JSON (the ECS API returns an XML response, I myself would like to have the ability to convert this to JSON - but optional)
