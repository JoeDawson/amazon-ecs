# Amazon ECS for Laravel

This is currently a work in progress, if you come across this as it is right now - **please use your own risk**.

Documentation will be updated tomorrow (as of this commit).

### Planned

- **Finish documentation!**
- Better exception handling
- Cart abilities, such as modifying, adding, clearing etc.
- XML to JSON (the ECS API returns an XML response, I myself would like to have the ability to convert this to JSON - but optional)
